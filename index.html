    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p1>Hello, My name is Cuong Lam. I'm currently 31 years old and I'm attending UCLA's extension full stack program. I really enjoy coding and I hope to get the most out of this program. My goal for this course is to be the best coder out of my class and master all the languages taught in this course. My goal after the program is, besides finding a good job, going into the gaming industry. It is a dream of mine to work on a AAA game some day. I've been a interested in games since I was a child so naturally, I'd be very interested in games. Some of my other hobbies include Movies, Music, Food, and Traveling.</p1>

    <p2>I will say this now, my favorite movie of all time is Taxi Driver. I have to say, it is ONE OF THE BEST westerns I have ever seen. Especially since it is a western that takes place in modern times! I usually listen to all kinds of genre's yet, I don't like Heavy stuff like death metal, etc. My favorite food is Hot Pot, which is a soup base that you toss a lot of food in and share as a group. The last thing I love to do, although I wish I did more, is traveling. I've been to several countries and it is ALWAYS interesting to find out new customs and cultures.</p2>
